Type in a technology choice and the AI blockchain decentralized markets will decide if it's web scale or not.

Please don't be offended, this is all just a joke.

## To run

1. `python3 -m http.server 8666`
1. Go to http://localhost:8666

## To add new technologies

1. Think of something "funny" about a particular technology and whether it's web scale or not.
1. Keep your so-called "joke" to yourself for a while.
1. Think about whether "funny-ness" is truly subjective or if there are objective measures of how "funny" something can truly be.
1. Remember everything you learned about Plato in `Philosophy 101` and objective beauty and ponder whether humor is similar.
1. Decide if your "joke" is actually funny or not.
1. Make a PR for `data.json` in this repo.
1. Don't be offended if I never merge it in. I'm pretty lazy.
